# W0212: acessing a protected member of the ConfigParser(), only way to support automatic dataclassing
# R0902: annotation CLI is complicated
# R0201: method could be a function, but needs to be a method to match other interfaces
# W0603: using `global` statement to accelerate parsing
# W1202: f-string formatting in a log statement, but seems necessary
# E0213: method should have `self` as first argument, but can't do that in this special case
