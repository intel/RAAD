   "Incorrect DRAM Refresh Rate settings. All Data Center products DRAM are spec'd for max "
   'operating temperature at 95C, however this would require DRAM to be configured to double '
   "refresh rate. This requirement wasn't documented clearly, resulting in all CD/CDR family's "
   'DRAM to run in single refresh rate, which max operating temperature is rated at 85C. Form '
   'factor with low DRAM thermal margin (E1.S, DualPort, M.2) coupled with marginal DRAM component '
   'would hit this ASSERT. ADP and forward, this requirement is clarified in HAS. One way to '
   'confirm this failure is to configure the failing to double refresh rate (boot loader change), '
   'and reproduce the issue.']
