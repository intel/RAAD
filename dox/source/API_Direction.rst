General API Background and Guidelines
#####################################

Summary
*******
The oneAPI programming model provides a comprehensive and unified portfolio of developer tools that can be used across data management engine, hardware targets, including a range of performance libraries spanning several workload domains. The libraries include functions custom-coded for each target architecture, so the same function call delivers optimized performance across supported architectures. Python, C, and C++ are the languages to based encourage ecosystem collaboration and innovation. To ensure comparability, we will want to have Cython and C/C++ APIs to connect to DPC++. The Intel wide APIs are defined in One API with the programming manual.

Within our development, we are embracing the Intel One direction and vision by collaborating on enabling Machine Programming. Machine programming is a fusion of different fields. It uses automatic programming technique, from precise (e.g., formal program synthesis) to probabilistic (e.g., differentiable programming) methods. It also uses and learns from everything we've built in hardware and software to date. Powered with OneAPI, we have a formula to cohesively have: onsite response, quality products, a service to improve up-time, and much more. Our usage has shown a 7x SLA speedup via automation of telemetry; thus, we are continuing the effort to scale organizations.

    Three Pillars of Machine Programming.

High-level compelling endpoint general areas:
    - Productivity: Improve programmer productivity by at least two orders of magnitude.
        - Requiring < 1% of today's effort.
    - Synthesis: Superhuman software creation in terms of:

Storage Container Web Interface and API Requirements to Data Lake Store
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Creation of Web Server(s):
    1. Reserve sub-domain
    #. Create Apache Server instance linked with sub domain
    #. Create a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
    #. Create a TLS for Web interaction (Open SSL)
    #. Add required analytics tracker for client webpage
    #. Tracks information such as: MAC address, IP, Username, Geographic, Machine token identifier
    #. Use interface such as:
        - Hardened PHP
        - http strict transport security (hsts)
    #. Create isolated verification virtual machine instances
        - Instances check each of the items above. The server will not perform these tasks individually as it will be the first line of content verification.
        - Use a random of 3 multi casters virtual machines to simultaneously process the transaction in the case of a single attack vector.
    #. Disable
        - Any additional ports
        - Remote access to File upload server
        - Write OS privileges for all users except service and stage data into containers.
    #. APIs
        - Python 3.x
        - HTTP(s)/2 TLS
        - Unique VPN DMZ for Telemetry

Security Requirement(s)
-----------------------
- Attack Protection Vectors
    - Entry point cannot execute binaries.
    - Each file should be scanned for malicious content.
    - File meta cannot be in plain text to ensure no file paths can be exploited.
    - Payload Size Limitation(s)
        - 1500 bytes of payload, the limit set by the IEEE 802.3 standard.
        - 9000 bytes of payload, the limit set by jumbo frames.
    - File Content Transaction(s)
        - Each set of content should have a SHA- 512 signature.
        - Data Encryption Public RSA Key 4096 bit.
        - Each data area section for construction of the payload we should have a SHA for a collection of blocks with a secondary private key only known to the tool.
    - Distributed denial of service (DDOS)
        - Connection instances are limited to the current usage of the server
            - For example if the server has 256 connections and only two users then the split would be 128. When more users  connect these should be reduced to a minima of one connection with round Robbin Quality of  Service (QoS).
- Cipher Point(s)
    - Key Exchange
