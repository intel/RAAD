Building of Personal Brand
Ann Bastianelli explains how to use your skills and build a personal brand through being self-awareness, telling your story with you life, and deepen your relationships.
    - People do not care about what you know, until they know how much you care.
    - A powerful personal brand means you will: lead more, win more, and earn more
    - Surround yourself with those focused on a goal and not on you.
    - When given feedback, treat it as gift and become self aware to the provided information.

Guide to Action Required (ARs)
******************************
Before assigning or receiving ARs; review the following:

Do(s) for Communication

    - Effort: The effort should be reasonable given the variables of the task.
    - Specific: ensure there are details of what exactly to be accomplished
    - When: Confirm the date and ensure why the target is critical.
    - Who: Be clear there is an owner for the AR
    - Confirmation: To give an action the receiver must and agrees.
    - Owner Agree(s): Ensure the owner is present, agrees, and knows the details. The owner should be sure the AR can be complete or offer details for actions if it cannot be.
    - Priority: Any assigned AR should be confirmed with its priority and can be met with other deliverables on the owner.
    - Ask Question(s)
        - Clarification: The owner should ensure they understand the key aspects of an action item and if they are not clear do not accept and follow up.
        - Division: If the action is similar between two individual ensure each deliverable is disjoint or has a collaborative sync to ensure everyone is on the same page.
        - Fit: Ensure the action is a correct fit withy your skill set or role.
        - Follow up: Before the due date of the AR; it is good behavior to give updates on the trend of completion. The trend is valuable for additional help and managing inbound change.
        - Digital: To ensure expectations are set; follow up each AR with an Email or a set of meeting notes for the deliver to agrees with.
        - Decision: For the AR conclusion, will you have a decision on the overall drive of the effort?

Avoid for Efficiency

    - Ambiguous: Actions in which do not change decisions or execution.
        - Items where a decision is blocked pending gathering more data. These actions require a separate confirmation and should be reviewed to ensure the tasks are not nebulous.
    - Duplication: Similar ARs to multiple people; each owner should have a separate AR. In the event, it is a team AR ensure there is a single owner for delivery or team.

Overview

Intel has a well-developed internship program serving thousands of students who are preparing for real careers outside of college. Our goal is to provide real-world, thought-provoking internships to undergraduate and graduate-level students. Historically, more than 60 percent of our interns go on to accept full-time opportunities with Intel after graduation. There is no better way to learn than to experience things first-hand.

Intel internships offer students a chance to get real-world experience with ownership of projects from day one, as well as the opportunity to develop a network of contacts for their future. Intel managers encourage students to take the initiative and develop programs that meet their particular interests.

Reference https://jobs.intel.com/page/show/internships

As an intern at Intel, you will enjoy a variety of benefits including:

    - Real-world experience with leading-edge technologies
    - Competitive salaries
    - Networking with Intel managers and executives
    - Access to Intel University classes for professional and personal development
    - Consideration for full-time employment when you graduate

An Inside Look:

What's It Like to Intern for Intel?
    - Eligible candidates for temporary full-time positions are students who have not yet graduated and are working towards a relevant Bachelor's, Specialist's, Master's, or PhD degree from an accredited academic institute.
    - Before applying, please review our internship requirements and inquire with your school about receiving credit for your internship. Internship opportunities may not be available at all locations. Check the job listing for additional information.
    - Submitting an application does not guarantee an intern assignment, and an intern assignment does not guarantee regular full-time employment upon completion of your degree program. An Intel interview panel reviews all applicants and selects all interns. Applicants are screened for communication, interpersonal, and job-related technical skills.

    #. Write a Biography
        - Joseph’s undergraduate/graduate career at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) has allowed him to participate in several domestic and international projects. A few of significant projects have included: similarity search, generalized interfaces for hardware accelerators, hardware accelerator optimization, memory abstraction/standardization of hardware systems, and enhancements of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) processors. In these projects, he excelled in project management, coordination, and collaboration with his peers. Throughout these experiences, Joseph demonstrated determination, leadership, technical merit, and ability, to independently learn/improve skill sets. Collaboration with multidisciplinary groups taught him effective communication and problem-solving skills. Joseph has collaborated with research/technical groups such as Jacquard Computing, Pico Computing, Intel Corporation, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), National University of Singapore (NUS), and University of Bern.
    #. Share what you are passionate about science.
        - My passion for science was ignited at an early age in the form of curiosity, and it all began at my grandparent’s house. Every summer, I would visit my grandparents for a month or so and each time I entered the garage I was enchanted by my grandfather’s radio communication system. Its buttons, knobs, lights and sounds were too stimulating for my curious nature to resist. One afternoon, I decided to investigate my grandfather’s elaborate radio communication system by decomposing it on the garage floor. Upon discovery, my grandfather was more impressed than angry because I was able to separate the parts by levels of similarity. Instead of punishing me, my grandfather decided he would teach me how to reconstruct the radio communication system. After a week of rebuilding, my grandfather not only taught me how to build a transistor radio, but also about the fundamental concepts of electricity, circuits, and radio communication. From then on, my grandfather encouraged my curiosity with a new project every summer and thus began my mechanically inclined nature.
    #. Discussion
        - Share a share a unique fact.
            - I have a soft spot for cats and I adopted mine after a friend could not keep him. Coincidentally, she named him Joseph. He is a Savannah and Domestic Mix T5 at about 17+ years old and he is so large I take him for walks on a leash around my condo complex.
        - Share a share a trait.
            - A majority of my friends say I am one of the reliable and hard working people they have met.
        - Share an achievement.
            - I achieved athlete of the year my senior year in High school for competing and placing in the highest levels of competition in: Olympic Wrestling (Folk/Freestyle), Football (Full/Tail back, outside-line backer, and special teams receiving)  Track & Field (100, 200, 400 meter dash), and Tennis (singles)
        - Share something what you are thankful for.
            - I am thankful for the mentors I have had in my life including: my grandfather, high school mathematics teacher, academic advisor, and many more. Without them and embracing my potential; I would most likely would not have as rich of a life as I have had up to now.

Patent Construction
###################

Types
    - Utility: these are processes, manufacturing, and compositions of matter these typically do something in the industrial or technology process. In the context of matter, these would be a process for creating new compounds.
    - Design: These are the functional or structural feature; which require a utility patent as well. The structural or appearance of the object requires the utility since by itself it would be obvious to patent.
    - Plant: Distinctive features of a plant in which do not appear without cultivation. An additional component is the grafting or cutting of the plant in the seed to the mature state.

Features
*********
The features of a quality patent are first and foremost the baseline of the document. The overall items should have clarity and conciseness on conveying these elements below.

    - Novelty: The originality of the invention is the foremost piece to highlight. Patents without novelty; event with high quality will be rejected. The goal of a patent is to protect intellectual property of something new.
    - Value-to-Intel: These include quantification of  benefits in example
    - Detectability: The techniques in order to show replication, use of a patent through the process, and design through observation.
    - Implementability: The how to realize the technology with today's state. For example in code, we may use a programming language to create software or hardware. In the physical world this would be the process in how to change in aspects of the material through technologies such lithography.

General Guidelines
*******************
    #. Define acronyms on first usage.
        - I.E. PRD is product requirement document
    #. Diagrams for aiding in the invention should be present in the first two pages. These diagrams need to be clearly labeled, explained, and referenced in the writing.
        - Each of the stages of the patent
    #. Use precise language such that it can be clearly seen it is better. Do not use optimal or similar wording unless it can be proven.
    #. Title: Typically patents include method and apparatus with these in mind:
        - Distinction between a claim to a product, device, or apparatus, all of which are tangible items, and a claim to a process, which consists of a series of acts or steps.
        - Apparatus claims cover what a device is, not what a device does.
        - A process, however, is a different kind of invention. It consists of acts or steps, rather than tangible things. A process, therefore, has to be carried out or performed.
        - Sale of an apparatus capable of performing the patented method is not a sale of the method. A method claim is directly infringed only by the entity usurping the patented method
    #. Construction
        - Problem definition provide a definition for the class of challenges not explored or apparent in usage. These cannot include properties of nature or strict mathematics.
        - Previously solutions state what is the current known methods; in which, the patenter write is not to search or explore before writing the patent.
            - Disadvantages within the space are used to point out the difficulties or gaps in the known methods.
        - Short summary is the overall idea pointing out the features with any theoretical or empirical value.
            - Advantages are points in which the idea makes the challenge problem space more explored address the problem directly.
    #. Detection Considerations
        - Reverse engineering, 0.5 weight not practical
        - Hardware/Software Telemetry.
        - Binary instrumentation.
        - Data injection for behavior trace paths according to the stages.
        - Compiler level through pin with static or dynamic compilation.
        - Latency, throughput, and the Intermediate Representation (IR) similarity core is high.
        - Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) or Finite State Machine (FSM) creation from sequences of commands, inputs, outputs, and actions.
    #. Invention Details
        - These are the bulk of the patent application and for the most part could be considered the appendix for the attorney to use in filing the formal application. This section not be required to get the high level idea; however, it is crucial to providing the methods and apparatuses.
