datacontrol Module

DESCRIPTION:A number of scripts that allow automatic reserving and editing of 
Firmware Source (FW src) code data structures unique identifier and meta data information.

Dependencies: tqdm, installation: https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm#latest-pypi-stable-release

TO RUN:
see testAll script found in currentDir/test for example commands of how to run. 

Additional information available
at the Wiki: https://nil/github/projects/repo/dataControlGen.py#users-statistic

Run in --debug mode to keep all generated files for inspection.

OUTPUT:Output will be generated in three distinct locations. 

* ssddev-meta/DATACONTROL: (structures-meta.csv)
 is generated by datacontrolGenMain.py, which pulls, edits, and commits changes to a
a remote repository containing the FW structure telemetry information, including
reserve status, author and approver information. To see these changes, see: 
ssddev-meta in Bitbucket (linked: https://nil/github/projects/repo-meta/browse)


* root/tools/lib/datacontrol: structures.csv is updated by datacontrolGen.py
in this directory via datacontrolGenMain.py in lib/datacontrol. Again: 
datacontrolGen is the front-facing script, which calls datacontrolGenMain,
which performs all the work. See lib/datacontrol for all changes produced


*/src: contains datacontrol.h, used widely by telemetry scripts in this repo.
datacontrol.h is generated as a subset of information contained in structures.h
so ensure this is correctly updated before generating datacontrol.h. 
(Integration of datacontrol.h generation into buildgen3 TBD.)
