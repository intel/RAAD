## Developer Information
Hello Fellow Developers, 

The repository is currently in *pre-alpha*; which means there are many bugs, mixing of language sets (I.E. Python 2.x/3.x. and C/C++ standards), and unfinished code sets. The code is being released for reference and not all members may be participating. Please feel free to fix the code through pull requests. 

* Please note for the best experience use **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS x86_64** (https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) as the development environment.

New development should have a unit test capability built in to ensure there are no regressions.
* Auto doxygen location
    * RAAD\dox\build\index.html
* Docstring Style
    * https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html
* Example documentation execute order:
    * `cd RAAD\dox\source\`
    * `python findClasses.py`
    * `cd ..`
    * `make clean`
    * `make html`

An example python template of a can be seen in RAAD\src\software\utility\templateUtility.py

## Summary
Telemetry is the state space snapshot which tightly-couple specialists to pertinent data, remotely, removing the cyber physical challenges with interacting on complex platforms. The immediate benefit is precise and rapid data extraction correlated to customer platforms. The purposeful subsequent benefit is reactive-proactive real-time analytics for monitoring of client platforms and data centers. The real-time processing of the data enables data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The application of these techniques is given in an instance of Intel SSDs and can be applied to technological eco-systems.
